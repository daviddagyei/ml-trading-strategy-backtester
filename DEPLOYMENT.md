# ðŸš€ Streamlit Cloud Deployment Checklist

## Pre-deployment Checklist

### âœ… Files Ready for Deployment
- [x] `app.py` - Main Streamlit application
- [x] `strategies.py` - Strategy implementations
- [x] `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies with pinned versions
- [x] `packages.txt` - System dependencies
- [x] `.streamlit/config.toml` - Streamlit configuration
- [x] `.gitignore` - Git ignore file
- [x] `README.md` - Updated with deployment instructions

### âœ… Code Optimizations
- [x] Added `@st.cache_data` decorators for performance
- [x] Error handling and user feedback
- [x] Input validation and edge case handling
- [x] Package availability checking
- [x] Session state management

### âœ… Configuration Files
- [x] Streamlit config optimized for production
- [x] Requirements pinned to specific versions
- [x] System packages specified
- [x] Secrets template created (optional)

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Repository Setup
1. Push all changes to your GitHub repository
2. Ensure all files are committed and pushed

### 2. Streamlit Cloud Deployment
1. Go to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io)
2. Sign in with your GitHub account
3. Click "New app"
4. Select your repository
5. Set main file path: `app.py`
6. Click "Deploy"

### 3. Post-deployment
1. Test all functionality on the deployed app
2. Monitor for any runtime errors
3. Update documentation with live app URL

## Environment Variables (Optional)
These can be set in Streamlit Cloud settings:
- `DEFAULT_TICKER=AAPL`
- `DEFAULT_START_DATE=2020-01-01`

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Package Installation Failures
- **Solution**: Check requirements.txt for correct package names and versions
- **Fallback**: Use requirements without version pins if specific versions fail

### Issue: Memory Errors
- **Solution**: The app uses caching to minimize memory usage
- **Monitor**: Large backtests may need optimization for cloud limits

### Issue: Long Loading Times
- **Solution**: Caching is implemented for data loading and strategy execution
- **Tip**: First run may be slower, subsequent runs will be faster

## Performance Notes
- Data loading is cached for 1 hour
- Strategy results are cached for 30 minutes
- Large datasets (>5 years) may take longer to process
- Interactive plots are optimized for web display

## Success Indicators
âœ… App deploys without errors
âœ… All strategies run successfully
âœ… Interactive plots display correctly
âœ… Data export functions work
âœ… Error messages are user-friendly
âœ… Performance is acceptable for typical use cases

## Next Steps After Deployment
1. Share the live app URL
2. Monitor usage and performance
3. Gather user feedback
4. Plan future enhancements
