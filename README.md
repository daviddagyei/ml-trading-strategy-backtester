**🌐 Live Demo**: [View the deployed app](https://ml-trading-strategies.streamlit.app)

### Option 2: Automated Local Setup

```bash
# Make the setup script executable
chmod +x run_app.sh

# Run the setup and launch script
./run_app.sh
```

### Option 3: Manual Local Setup

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Launch the application
streamlit run app.py
```

## 🔧 Deployment Configuration

The app is optimized for Streamlit Cloud deployment with:

- **Configuration**: `.streamlit/config.toml` for production settings
- **Dependencies**: `requirements.txt` with pinned versions for reproducibility
- **System packages**: `packages.txt` for additional system dependencies
- **Caching**: `@st.cache_data` decorators for optimal performance
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive exception handling and user feedback

### Environment Variables (Optional)

For enhanced functionality, you can set these environment variables in Streamlit Cloud:

```bash
# Optional: Custom default settings
DEFAULT_TICKER=AAPL
DEFAULT_START_DATE=2020-01-01
```

## 📋 Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Required packages (automatically installed):
  - streamlit
  - plotly
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - yfinance
  - scikit-learn
  - ta (technical analysis)
  - arch (GARCH modeling)
  - matplotlib

##  Architecture

The application follows object-oriented design principles with clean separation of concerns:

```
├── app.py              # Streamlit dashboard interface
├── strategies.py       # Strategy implementations (OOP)
├── requirements.txt    # Package dependencies
├── run_app.sh         # Setup and launch script
└── README.md          # This file
```

### Core Classes

- **BaseStrategy**: Abstract base class defining the strategy interface
- **MACrossoverStrategy**: Moving average crossover with ML filtering
- **VolatilityStrategy**: Volatility forecasting with risk management
- **StrategyFactory**: Factory pattern for strategy creation
- **Metrics**: Performance metrics data container

##  Strategy Details

### Moving Average Crossover Strategy

**Parameters:**
- Short/Long MA windows
- ML holding period
- Probability threshold for signal filtering
- Slippage and transaction costs

**Features:**
- Technical indicators (MACD, RSI, Bollinger Bands)
- Time-series cross-validation
- Signal quality prediction
- Risk-adjusted performance metrics

### Volatility Forecasting Strategy

**Parameters:**
- Volatility target
- Maximum leverage
- Rebalancing frequency
- Transaction costs

**Features:**
- GARCH(1,1) volatility modeling
- Random Forest ML forecasting
- Dynamic position sizing
- Risk-based portfolio management

##  Usage Guide

1. **Select Strategy**: Choose between MA Crossover or Volatility Forecasting
2. **Configure Parameters**: Adjust strategy parameters in the sidebar
3. **Set Market Data**: Enter ticker symbol and date range
4. **Run Backtest**: Click the "Run Backtest" button
5. **Analyze Results**: Review performance metrics and interactive charts
6. **Export Data**: Download results for further analysis

##  Performance Metrics

The dashboard provides comprehensive performance analytics:

- **CAGR**: Compound Annual Growth Rate
- **Sharpe Ratio**: Risk-adjusted returns
- **Maximum Drawdown**: Worst peak-to-trough decline
- **Total Return**: Cumulative performance
- **Volatility**: Annualized return volatility
- **Trade Count**: Number of executed trades

##  Customization

The modular design allows easy extension:

1. **Add New Strategies**: Inherit from `BaseStrategy` class
2. **Custom Indicators**: Extend indicator calculation methods
3. **New Visualizations**: Add custom Plotly charts
4. **Enhanced Analytics**: Implement additional performance metrics

##  Example Usage

```python
# Create strategy instance
from strategies import StrategyFactory

strategy = StrategyFactory.create_strategy(
    "MA Crossover",
    ticker="AAPL",
    start_date="2020-01-01",
    short_window=20,
    long_window=100
)

# Run backtest
results = strategy.run_backtest()

# Access results
baseline_equity = results["baseline"]["equity"]
ml_equity = results["ml_filtered"]["equity"]
```
